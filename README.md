# data-active-exploration-hmdp

This repository is for providing data used in the paper about active exploration submitted to IROS 2020.

> Yoshino R, Takano T, Tanaka H and Taniguchi T  Active Exploration for Unsupervised Object Categorization Based on Multimodal Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, submitted to IROS2020

In the experiment, features extracted for each modality for each object are used.
The dataset is same as the experiment in the paper about active perception [1].

* Dataset
  * https://github.com/tanichu/data-active-perception-hmdp
  * ./modality-data/training/ (17 objects) and ./modality-data/test/ (17 objetcs) were used for active exploratoin experiment.

* Results
  * (under construction)
  * Some descriptons of the files are in Japanese
